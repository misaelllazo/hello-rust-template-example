# Kusto Query for MIP Scanner

> [!NOTE]
> The next queries are set in 90 days as an example, you can modify that value
> In both queries at the final appears the Local domain ".kazdemos.org" this is used to remove the domain from your device name, you can change by your own domain.

## This is the query used to collect data from MIP Scanner for discovery purpose

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please remember that you need to have Scanner activities after the MPARR Collector was start to collect data, any previously activity is not collected.
